PSYCLEAN BULLETHELL ROUGELIKE DANCEFLOOR CLICKER

This mini game takes place on the different dancefloors of the rpg overworld map.
each dancefloor has several levels. 
you run a level until you succeed, then automatically spawn back in the rpg world, where things change due to your level progress.

Map: dancefloors
- 3 characters with different tasks (picker, sucker, psychonaut)
- Enemies: different trash
- Weapons: sucker, picker, juggling tools. 
- Weapon upgrades must be crafted or bought or looted in the overworld map.

On the dancefloor, you can only get level-ups, buttcoins and moral points, which fill the moral meter of the group.
You can switch between your characters with a hotkey. 

You have 3 volunteer classes: picker, sucker, psychonaut. 
Each has a basic move (and optionally a group ulti at some point in the mid game.)
Each of them has a certain task: 
picker picks big trash. 
sucker sucks butts and confetti. 
The psychonaut impresses guests (fill up empathy meter), who will then stop dropping trash.

Each guest has an impression meter. As long as they are not fully impressed, they will keep dropping trash.
So the task is to run around on the floor between people, and find a system to pick, suck and then impress as fast as possible. 
the moral constantly drops as long as there is trash on the ground. te speed is determined by the total amount of trash.
There is no time limit, but the players moral will drain, the more trash is on the ground. 

Every once in a while you loot items in the trash, that are either directly useable like snacks for moral, 
or items that you need to craft better snacks/specific upgrades / stuff for the story. 

UPGRADES
you can upgrade each weapon with gadgets and upgrades: attack range, reload times and impression strength.
there is at least one parameter in a weapon, that can not be upgraded. it only changes per type: a different sucker type will have a better motor (more gravity).


DIFFICULTY
some floors demand certain tools to even get there, or to play them: in the bunker, you need a head torch or torch upgrade, otherwise the range is -60%

The chill floor will have mainly sitting people, while the dancefloor has an amount of guests that are constantly moving on and off screen. 
So we can build different play styles on each floor.
Level difficulties will not only be the amount of guests and trash at start and during the run, 
but also the movement of the guests and circumstances like for example 
rain, which will drain the moral constantly. - or 
nighttime, which decreases the range to 2 squares 
(just an example to create more variety inside levels and quests)

CRAFTING
an item can contain an own inventory:
- trashbag: 20 slots (turns items to trash)
- good picker: 2 slots (upgrades only)
- sandwich: 3 slots (only food ingredients)

most crafting is done at a specific crafting station.
the player is encouraged to make intuitive crafting recipes by trial. more complex recipes for certain upgrades get provided during the story.


----------------------
Goal

Goal is to finish off the floor and its people litter-free and emphatic. The faster you are, the more additional buttcoins you may earn. 
there may be 4 rounds per level, where the guests behave differently or spawn during the run. weather or other circumstances might demand an upgrade or tool.
Use buttcoins to buy upgrades and stuff you need for the next level in the story mode.

the story progress and the floor progress are interconnected through the necessity of upgrades and new weapons. 
the story contains quests and other minigames.
